# IITGN Campus Map

This project provides an interactive map of the IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) campus using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. It allows users to view various campus buildings, filter them by category, and search for buildings by name or information. The map also provides detailed popups with additional information about each building.

## Project Overview

### Objective:
The goal of the project is to create an interactive, easy-to-use map of the IIT Gandhinagar campus for students and faculty.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GeoJSON
- Leaflet

### Features:
- View the campus map with multiple categories of buildings.

- View detailed information about each building with a popup, including a link to its location on OpenStreetMap.

## Live Link

You can view the live version of the website [here](https://ushasree-3.github.io/Interactive-Institute-Map/).

## Features to be Improved/Enhanced

- **Better Search Results**: Implement exact matches and better handling for large datasets.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the map is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.
- **More Information**: Add additional information, such as floor maps or building schedules, in the popup windows.

## Future Work

- Integration of more detailed building information (e.g., floor plans, events).
- Integration with the campus's internal systems to provide real-time data (e.g., building availability or events).
- Implementation of a routing feature for navigation within the campus.
